				<h3 class="text text-center mb-3">How does javascript work?</h3>
				<p>
					Javascript is interprated programming language, its not compile
					language language like c++,java. We know that javascript is very much
					useful for DOM manupolation system .However, javascript works
					functionally and it makes interective for a site or any applications.
					Its also known as a scripting language which allows to implement a
					complex feature in web. In contrast to other languages, javaScript is
					also dynamically typed. Javascript variables declared with var can
					hold any data type, including INT, TEXT, BOOLEAN, and complex data
					types like as OBJECT and ARRAY.

					What does javascript eventListiner do?
				</h3>

				<p>
					The Javascript event listener is an interface that lets us manage user
					interaction with our programme, such as when a user clicks a button.
					When the event it's listening for occurs, we also know that the event
					listener will call a given function.Furthermore, event listeners, like
					event handlers, make it easier to govern how an event reacts to
					boiling. Except that we may attach as many event listeners to a single
					event on a single element as we want. For example, event listeners if
					we create two functions and use the onclick event handler to run both
					of them on a button click, as illustrated in the following example:
					const example = document.getElemtsById("example");
					example.addEventListener("click", () => { console.log("clicked
					example"); });

					What is the diffrence between session storage and local storage?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The key contrast between session storage and local storage is that
					local storage data typically does not erase from the storage, even
					when the browser is resumed, but session storage data is often lost
					when the page is closed. The local storage attribute is used to access
					a page's local storage area without a time limit, and it will be
					available whenever you use that page. The basic difference among local
					and session storage is that local storage has no expiration date,
					however session storage data is deleted when the browser tab is
					closed. We cant get the data after browser closed as session has out,
					thus the name -session. Intrestingly say, the Javascript DOM allows
					access to both storages.
